# Navbar Role-Based Navigation Update

## Overview
Updated the Navigation component to display role-specific navigation links for Learners, Creators, and Admins. Also added an overall progress bar for Learners in the navbar.

## Changes Made

### 1. Role-Specific Navigation Items

#### Learner Navigation Links
- **Dashboard** - `/dashboard`
- **Browse Courses** - `/courses`
- **My Learning** - `/my-courses`
- **My Progress** - `/progress`
- **Certificates** - `/certificates`

#### Creator Navigation Links
- **Creator Dashboard** - `/creator/dashboard`
- **My Courses** - `/creator/dashboard`
- **Browse Courses** - `/courses`
- **Analytics** - `/creator/dashboard`

#### Admin Navigation Links
- **Admin Dashboard** - `/admin/dashboard`
- **Review Creators** - `/admin/review/creators`
- **Review Courses** - `/admin/review/courses`
- **Analytics** - `/admin/analytics`
- **All Courses** - `/courses`

### 2. Progress Bar for Learners

Added a dynamic progress bar in the navbar that:
- Only appears for users with the `LEARNER` role
- Fetches overall progress from all enrolled courses
- Displays average progress percentage
- Includes smooth animation transitions
- Shows a progress bar with gradient colors (green to blue)
- Includes a trending up icon for visual appeal

### 3. Implementation Details

**File Modified:** `/src/components/auth/Navigation.tsx`

**Key Features:**
1. **Dynamic Navigation**: Navigation items automatically switch based on user role
2. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress data fetched from the API
3. **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile views
4. **Smooth Animations**: Uses Framer Motion for elegant transitions
5. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded progress bar and percentage display

**Code Structure:**
```typescript
// Define role-specific navigation arrays
const learnerNavItems: NavigationItem[] = [...]
const creatorNavItems: NavigationItem[] = [...]
const adminNavItems: NavigationItem[] = [...]

// Helper function to get navigation based on role
const getNavigationItems = (role: User['role']): NavigationItem[] => {
  switch (role) {
    case 'LEARNER': return learnerNavItems;
    case 'CREATOR': return creatorNavItems;
    case 'ADMIN': return adminNavItems;
    default: return learnerNavItems;
  }
}

// In component: fetch progress for learners
useEffect(() => {
  if (user.role === 'LEARNER') {
    const fetchProgress = async () => {
      // Fetch and calculate average progress
    };
    fetchProgress();
  }
}, [user.role]);
```

### 4. Progress Bar UI

The progress bar section includes:
- **Header**: "Overall Progress" with trending up icon
- **Percentage Display**: Shows current progress percentage
- **Visual Bar**: Gradient-filled progress bar with smooth animation
- **Styling**: Matches the brand color scheme with white/transparent overlays

## Testing

### Build Status
✅ Build completed successfully without errors
✅ TypeScript compilation passed
✅ All routes generated correctly

### Manual Testing Required

1. **Learner Role**
   - [ ] Navigate to dashboard as learner
   - [ ] Verify learner-specific links appear (Dashboard, Browse Courses, My Learning, My Progress, Certificates)
   - [ ] Check that progress bar appears in navbar
   - [ ] Verify progress percentage updates correctly
   - [ ] Enroll in courses and verify progress calculation

2. **Creator Role**
   - [ ] Navigate to dashboard as creator
   - [ ] Verify creator-specific links appear (Creator Dashboard, My Courses, Browse Courses, Analytics)
   - [ ] Confirm progress bar does NOT appear for creators
   - [ ] Test all creator navigation links

3. **Admin Role**
   - [ ] Navigate to dashboard as admin
   - [ ] Verify admin-specific links appear (Admin Dashboard, Review Creators, Review Courses, Analytics, All Courses)
   - [ ] Confirm progress bar does NOT appear for admins
   - [ ] Test all admin navigation links

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - [ ] Test mobile menu on small screens
   - [ ] Verify role-specific links in mobile menu
   - [ ] Check progress bar display on mobile (for learners)

## API Dependencies

The progress bar feature depends on:
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/progress` (via `progressAPI.getProgress()`)
- **Expected Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "enrollments": [
        {
          "id": "...",
          "progress": 75,
          "course": { ... }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users see only relevant navigation options
2. **Role Clarity**: Clear distinction between user types
3. **Progress Visibility**: Learners can track their overall progress at a glance
4. **Reduced Clutter**: Navigation is focused and streamlined per role
5. **Easier Navigation**: Quick access to role-specific features

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add notifications/badges for pending actions (e.g., new courses for learners, pending reviews for admins)
- Include course completion count in progress bar tooltip
- Add quick stats for creators (course views, enrollments)
- Add admin dashboard summary in navbar (pending reviews count)
