## Test with Different Files

### Video Files to Test
‚úÖ Valid:
- MP4 (most common)
- MOV (Apple format)
- AVI (older format)
- WebM

‚ùå Invalid:
- PDF documents
- Images (JPG, PNG)
- Audio files (MP3)
- Text files

### File Sizes to Test
- ‚úÖ Small: <10MB (fast upload)
- ‚úÖ Medium: 50-100MB (typical)
- ‚úÖ Large: 200-400MB (slow upload)
- ‚ùå Too Large: >500MB (rejected)

## API Debugging

### Check Network Tab
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Perform an action
4. Look for:
   - POST /api/courses/:id/lessons/upload (get credentials)
   - POST https://api.cloudinary.com/... (upload)
   - POST /api/courses/:id/lessons (create lesson)
   - PATCH /api/lessons/:id (update)
   - DELETE /api/lessons/:id (delete)
```

### Common Response Codes
- `200 OK`: Success
- `400 Bad Request`: Validation error (check payload)
- `401 Unauthorized`: Token expired or missing
- `403 Forbidden`: Wrong role (need CREATOR)
- `404 Not Found`: Course/lesson doesn't exist
- `500 Server Error`: Backend issue (check logs)

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails
- Check file size (<500MB)
- Verify file is a video
- Check backend Cloudinary config
- Look for CORS errors in console

### Reorder Doesn't Persist
- Check PATCH /api/lessons/:id succeeded
- Verify order field in response
- Check if onLessonsUpdated is called

### Can't Submit Course
- Ensure at least 1 lesson exists
- Verify course status is DRAFT
- Check console for validation errors

### Images Not Loading
- Verify thumbnail URL is valid
- Check CORS policy for image host
- Try opening URL directly in browser

## Test Data

### Sample Course Data
```json
{
  "title": "Introduction to Web Development",
  "description": "Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch in this comprehensive course designed for beginners.",
  "thumbnailUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498050108023-c5249f4df085"
}
```

### Sample Lesson Titles
- "Getting Started with HTML"
- "CSS Basics and Styling"
- "JavaScript Fundamentals"
- "Building Your First Website"
- "Responsive Design Principles"

## Performance Testing

### Upload Performance
- 10MB file: ~5-15 seconds
- 50MB file: ~30-60 seconds
- 100MB file: ~1-2 minutes
- 500MB file: ~5-10 minutes

*Actual times depend on internet speed*

### Reorder Performance
- Should be instant (<100ms)
- No noticeable lag even with 50+ lessons

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All features work without errors
‚úÖ Upload progress shows accurately
‚úÖ Drag-and-drop feels smooth
‚úÖ Forms validate correctly
‚úÖ Status badges display properly
‚úÖ Permissions enforced by status
‚úÖ Error messages are helpful
‚úÖ Loading states prevent double-clicks
‚úÖ Animations enhance (not distract)
‚úÖ Responsive on mobile devices

## Known Limitations

1. **No parallel uploads**: Only one video at a time
2. **No resume uploads**: Refresh = restart
3. **No video preview**: Can't watch before publishing
4. **No transcript editing**: Plain text only
5. **No bulk operations**: Delete one by one
6. **No undo**: Deletions are permanent

## Next Test Phase

After basic functionality works:
1. Test with slow internet (throttle in DevTools)
2. Test with backend errors (stop server mid-upload)
3. Test with expired tokens (wait 24 hours)
4. Test with multiple tabs open
5. Test on mobile devices
6. Test with keyboard navigation only
7. Test with screen reader
